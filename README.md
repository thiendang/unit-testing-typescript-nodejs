## **Description**

**A must have skill for senior developers**

**Typescript** is getting more and more popularity and it is a required skill for many IT jobs. It's key feature is type safety, thus preventing bugs.

But yes another skill is very important for any programming job: **unit testing**. Combining these two techniques will result in solid, robust and bug free code.

This course will go beyond the basics of unit testing and teach you all you need to write real world, complex testing suites for **NodeJs** and **Typescript** applications using the most popular **JavaScript** testing library: **Jest**.

Using Jest as an unit testing library provides many advantages:

- Unitary unit testing library for running and structuring tests
- Extensive mocking, stubbing and spying capabilities
- Powerful matchers to create simple to read tests
- **Jest** ships as one unitary NPM package
- Jest is the default choice for **TypeScript React** projects

**Why unit testing NodeJs apps?**

Unit testing usually adds a lot to a code base, two or tree times in some cases. This also means that a lot of time needs to be invested in writing and setting up tests. But all this effort pays of: time, effort and headache of fixing bugs can be used for more fun activities.

**What you will get from this course:**

- setup NodeJs and Typescript projects from scratch
- implement unit testing with **Jest**
- learn about unit testing configuration with parameters like: roots, transform, testRegex or verbose
- learn about **Jest** test suites structure: describe with value, test, descriptions, hooks like beforeEach
- basic and advanced assertions, comparing primitive types, objects or even errors
- instantiating test double objects like mocks, stubs, spies or fakes.
- write **complex mock objects** which can be used with "strange" JavaScript libraries.
- inject doubles: directly inside the constructor, over the module or even using the objects prototype
- learn about deep mocks and matchers to make your tests even better
- integration tests for a **NodeJs** server application
- Conditionally and asynchronously skip tests

Dedicated sections on **unit testing mocks**:

- Jest mocks, spies
- How to use stubs
- London/Chicago testing approach, with the advantages and disadvantages of each one

In this course you will learn how to use **Test Driven Development (TDD)**:

- Analyze the advantages of **TDD**
- Hands-on practice with a great coding kata: password checker

Separate section on **Jest Integration tests for Rest APIs**:

- learn how to setup **integration tests**
- learn the difference between **integration tests** and **unit tests**
- write **integration tests** for a Rest API with **Jest**

Dedicated section on **Jest React unit testing**:

- How to test for **React components with Jest**
- How to test **React** async code
- How to debug **React Typescript** apps

The examples used in the course follow very high coding guidelines for Typescript, NodeJs and React. Async/await syntax is used for clear and concise code, and of course, you will see how to test asynchronous code, on server, but also in the front end.
